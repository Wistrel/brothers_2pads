# Brothers: A Tale of Two Joypads 

## Description:

A simple little AHK Script to sort out the lack of 2 Joypad
support in ["Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"](http://www.brothersthegame.com). To use, you will
either need [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com) installed (in which case, double click
the .ahk file once you have saved everything or, if you trust
me not to steal your secrets, just run the executable.

## Instructions:

To use, run this program then run Brothers. Once you are
in and have actually started a game press the SELECT button
on whichever Joypad isn't working. With any luck you now
have left side control for each of the two brothers, one
on each Joypad.

## Known issues: 

Unfortunately only running is supported (not walking) on the 
extra pad. Getting walking working too would involve the
installation a lot more kack I'm afraid and a lot more work
for me to reliably program. It isn't worth it either. First
time I played the game with a friend, we had no issues both 
working from a blutooth keyboard each. Running is fine :)
